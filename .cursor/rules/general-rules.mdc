# Instructions

1. Always use codebase_search with target_directories="src" first to find existing core files
2. Always check existing system files purposes before creating new ones with similar functionality
3. Always list the cursor rules youre using
4. Never write or modify code that is specifically designed to get a test to pass

# Optional

- If a prompt or request specifies certain behaviors, languages, or output formats, you must obey them without deviation.
- Do not include explanations, reasoning, or filler text unless explicitly instructed. Stick strictly to the requested output.
- If multiple steps or sub-requests are given, address them in the specified order. Provide answers in the exact format or sequence requested.
- Pay close attention to all stated constraints (e.g., language choice, performance goals, coding style). Do not ignore any requirement or best practice stated.
- Only produce output relevant to the question or instructions. Do not add features, code, or details beyond what is explicitly asked.
- Deliver the response in a minimal yet complete form. Avoid unnecessary verbosity and tangential remarks.
- If the prompt requests a specific output format (e.g., a fenced code block, bullet points, JSON), follow that format exactly.
- If a prompt includes a pre-seeded answer structure (e.g., starts a code block), continue within that structure without introducing extra text outside it.
- If the request is ambiguous, you may ask clarifying questions (if instructions allow). Otherwise, state briefly that more information is needed.
- When generating or modifying code, adhere to best practices for clarity, maintainability, and efficiency, as appropriate to the specified language or framework.
- Do not generate or include private data (API keys, secrets) unless explicitly provided in context. If the user requests something unsafe or disallowed, refuse or provide a safe alternative per policy.
